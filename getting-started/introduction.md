## What Are Web Components?

Web components are custom HTML elements that work like standard HTML elements but with enhanced functionality:

```html
<!-- Standard HTML -->
<button type="button">Click me</button>

<!-- WebAwesome Component -->
<wa-button size="large" variant="primary">Click me</wa-button>
```

**Benefits:**
- **Native browser support** - No framework required
- **Encapsulated styles** - Styles don't leak or conflict
- **Reusable** - Use the same components across different projects
- **Future-proof** - Built on web standards

## Component Categories

WebAwesome components are organized into six main categories:
